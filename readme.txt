Discover up to 90% more of your hidden traffic with triple tracking: cookie-based, cookie-less and server-side. Up and running in 5 minutes.

== Description ==

Many website visitors cannot be tracked using conventional tracking methods. Combine 3 different types of web tracking (with cookie, without cookie and server-side) with this plugin to reveal hidden traffic on your website and analyse up to 90% more in Matomo. Scalooper Traffic Insights is installed and ready to use in 5 minutes.
How Scalooper Traffic Insights works
Imagine you invest in marketing activities that drive visitors to your website, but you can only analyse a portion of the traffic. Time and budget are wasted if visitors go uncounted because they block cookies or access your site through platforms that make tracking impossible.
With Scalooper Traffic Insights you can also track these visitors!
If a visitor blocks cookies, in many cases they can still be tracked using cookie-less (i.e. anonymous or pseudonymised, depending on the Matomo setting) tracking. If this is not possible either, you would track the actual server accesses.
With this double fallback you will hardly miss anything that happens on your website.
The Benefits of Scalooper Traffic Insights
Scalooper Traffic Insights provides a number of advantages:
Traceability over days through cookie tracking (consent required)
Capture additional events that only happen in the browser, such as scrolling (setup required)
More accurate page view numbers through server-side tracking
Plausible TimeOnPage measurement through the Matomo HeartBeat timer
With this additional data you can evaluate natural traffic, marketing campaigns and usability optimisations in more detail than ever before. Focus on the true potential and use your time and budget in the most efficient way!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How long does it take to install the plugin? =
5 minutes. All you need to do is install and activate the plugin as usual and then enter the required Matomo data (URL, Site ID, API token).

= What are the advantages of each of the 3 tracking methods? =
Cookie tracking also tracks returning visitors. A cookie marks the visitor so you can identify them. However, the visitor must agree to the use of cookies.
Cookie-less tracking exactly measures the time spent on the site and records individual events on the site, such as clicking on a particular button. This only works if the visitor does not block the tracking script. In return, you can get rid of the cookie banner because tracking no longer takes place at the personal level, but only at the company level, which is in compliance with the GDPR.
The final layer, server-side tracking, records every access regardless of the visitor's settings or tools â€” but without identifying the visitor or the company.
